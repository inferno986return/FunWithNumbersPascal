# FunWithNumbersPascal
## Overview
A little sample commandline program I made in college years ago with the Pascal programming language.

The code itself generates 10 rather easy multiplication questions and scores them accordingly.

GitHub has a plethora of sample code to work with and I am happy to make a small contribution.

## Licensing

The code is licensed under the perhaps paradoxically named **The Unlicense**. This is akin to public domain. Being a sample project from 5 years ago in a language now considered obscure by many, I thought it was the most appropriate license for the project.
